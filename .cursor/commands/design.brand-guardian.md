## Instructions

1. **Load Brand Guardian Agent Context**
   - Read `.cursor/agents/design/01-brand-guardian.md` to understand the agent's role and decision framework
   - Load design context files:
     - `docs/design/principles.md` - Core design standards
     - `docs/design/brand.md` - Project-specific brand guidelines
     - `docs/design/project.md` - Project requirements and overrides

2. **Identify Target for Review**
   - If user provided a component/feature name, focus on that
   - If no specific target, review recent changes or current file context
   - Determine scope: single component, feature, or full page

3. **Execute Brand Compliance Check**
   - Follow the Brand Guardian decision framework
   - Check color compliance (hex codes, palette usage)
   - Validate typography (font families, sizes, weights)
   - Verify spacing system (base unit multiples)
   - Check logo usage if applicable
   - Flag white-label considerations

4. **Generate Compliance Report**
   - Create report in `docs/design/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-[feature]-compliance.md`
   - Use the Brand Guardian report template
   - Include status: ✅ APPROVED | ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW | ❌ CRITICAL VIOLATIONS
   - Document all findings with specific file paths and line numbers
   - Reference strictness levels from principles.md

5. **Provide Actionable Feedback**
   - List critical violations that must be fixed
   - Flag items needing human review with clear questions
   - Provide specific recommendations for fixes
   - Reference exact brand.md specifications
