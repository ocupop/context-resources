      - text_content: >-
          **Network connectivity** is described as the most accurate, expansive,
          and clear way to describe what 7SIGNAL does. It notes that
          **Connectivity** alone is accurate but may lack specificity for some
          businesses.
      - text_content: >-
          Focus on the **high level benefits** of the product and industry-specific
          **returns on investment**.
      - text_content: >-
          Use "**digital experience**" in context to concretely explain how
          7SIGNAL improves user experiences for work, engagement, and entertainment.
      - text_content: >-
          Highlight both **speed of resolution** and **overall optimization**: how
          issues are identified and resolved rapidly, and how they are prevented
          from occurring, while optimizing connectivity.
      - text_content: >-
          Describe how 7SIGNAL provides a unique **true view** of how devices and
          environments experience connectivity and user experience. Emphasize how
          this addresses a "**visibility gap**" for other products.
      - text_content: >-
          Demonstrate value by showing the UI, providing demos, and describing
          **concrete and realistic examples of ROI** for real companies.
      - text_content: >-
          Describe 7SIGNAL as more **powerful**, beyond what other (basic) network
          monitoring tools offer.

          Do not anchor too heavily on "**Wi-Fi**" or "**network**" as these terms
          are too narrow. However, it notes that these terms may be resonant for
          certain audiences and appropriate in specific contexts, so they don't need
          to be avoided entirely.
      - text_content: >-
          Do not focus too heavily on **product specifics and features** right away.
      - text_content: >-
          Do not use "**digital experience**" as a generic catch-all. While
          meaningful, it's most useful when describing the specifics of how
          7SIGNAL supports users.
      - text_content: >-
          Do not focus exclusively on **issue resolution or oversight**. The goal
          is to present a complete picture of how 7SIGNAL enables prevention and
          optimization.
      - text_content: >-
          Do not expect general audiences to understand "**client-side**",
          "**ground truth**", or **end-to-end** without context. These terms may be
          appropriate for technical audiences or with additional context.
      - text_content: >-
          Do not expect claims to be believed just because they are true; they need
          to feel real.
      - text_content: >-
          Do not over-anchor on complexity, as this may intimidate those seeking
          quick, simple solutions.
