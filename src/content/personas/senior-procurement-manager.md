## Overview

Michael is a seasoned procurement strategist responsible for supplier selection, risk reduction, and performance optimization. He demands data clarity, comparability, and defensibility. The platform must support his decision-making through efficient dashboards, filters, and exports.

## A Day in the Life

Michael begins his day by reviewing supplier communications and KPI dashboards. He navigates between ERP systems, procurement tools, and the supplier assessment platform to evaluate risks, opportunities, and upcoming contract decisions. He expects tools to work quickly and deliver accurate insights.

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Compare Suppliers for a Contract Renewal  
Michael uses the Supplier Index to filter and sort suppliers by Materiality, Maturity, and Influence. He then exports the shortlist.

### Scenario 2: Review High-Risk Suppliers
