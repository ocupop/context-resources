## [ClientName] | Stakeholder Interview Template

[RecordingLink]

**Introductions**

* Alex Lahr  
  * Ocupop for 6+ years, ACD leading strategy and content disciplines  
  * Worked with many clients over the years — from foundational strategy and positioning work, to website user experience strategy, to copywriting  
  * Succinct, clear, compelling storytelling  
  * Worked closely to develop user journey and story pathways for MP Materials site  
* [StakeholderName]

**Questions – Strategy**

Reading through all your materials and the team’s responses, we’ve identified three key focuses for the company right now, or your current workstreams/efforts

* Acquiring capital investments  
* Targeting key acquisitions  
* Establishing relationships to supply to businesses

Is this the correct read? Which are of the highest priority right now?

Incredibly clear, strategic direction from Throughline — Language is underscoring the seriousness AND scalability of your efforts  
As we think more broadly, how would you describe the personality of Principal Mineral?

Of the three messaging pillars (Defending Industry, Securing Materials, Driving Growth), which have you seen resonate most among the people with whom you’ve spoken to and interacted? Why is that?

Now thinking about the future — what is that main communications focal point, or thing that underpins your communications pillars?

* Highlighting network of domestic supply chain   
* Processed materials for industry “selling” or promotion  
* Perspective or expertise

5-Year Vision: What does Principal Mineral look like in five years?  
*Follow-up: Could be financially, number of OEMs or sources, arrangements, broader impacts with customers, etc.*

Camden Copper is obviously a huge success story, and a branding effort for them is on Ocupop’s radar as part of our larger collaboration. Knowing Camden Copper is one-such supplier or OEM — how important are the narratives of these facilities in the larger public story? In the larger Principal Mineral identity?

Platform vs Network — One thing that struck me as I was reviewing was this idea of Principal Mineral building a “platform” (set of conditions, process of investment & supply). But you also speak to—and showcase—your network of facilities (exclusive, commercial, pilot).

* I want to hear more about the nuances between defining your work as a platform or a network

IF TIME: Most impactful, or most compelling “use cases” or disciplines as part of the journey

**Questions \- Identity** 

From a visual standpoint, what is of the highest priority to include/focus?

* Materials \- the midstream composites, foils, metals  
* Industrial process \- factories and industry, whether producing or recycling  
* End use-cases or customer applications/business needs  
* Team, long-term expertise?

Is there anything we should look to avoid visually? Any sensitivities our stakeholders or audiences may have to certain imagery or themes?

* Recommendations for balancing

**Questions \- Web**

Priority audiences, actions for future website

* Ranking audiences for website  
  * Investors — those looking to fund  
  * B2B/industry commercial customers  
  * Partners / suppliers / OEMs / investment/acquisition targets  
  * Gov’t & policymakers

* What’s the main action you want people to take?   
  * Register for updates/emails (is there an email list?)  
  * Connect/contact  
  * Solicit investments \= no-no  
  * Contact about being a supplier/processor (acquired?) \= likely more selective process 

You’ve been exposed to the MP Materials website that Ocupop has done, as well as have a lot of experience with other prime contractors, investment companies. Are there **any features or functionality you’ve noticed across other websites that you like**, or wish you could offer on the Principal Minerals site?

Is there anything that competitors or contemporaries have on their websites, or as part of their digital presence that you think works well?
