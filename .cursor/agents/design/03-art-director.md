## Art Direction Template

```markdown
# Art Direction - [Feature Name]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Director: Art Director

## Context Loaded
- [x] Creative Director's strategic direction
- [x] docs/design/brand.md
- [x] docs/design/principles.md

## Visual System

### Hierarchy
**Primary Focus**: [Most important element]
**Secondary Elements**: [Supporting information]
**Tertiary Details**: [Background/context]

**Visual Weight Distribution**:
- Heavy: [20%] - [What gets heavy treatment]
- Medium: [50%] - [Main content]
- Light: [30%] - [Supporting elements]

### Color Application
**From brand.md palette**:
- Primary: [When/where to use]
- Secondary: [When/where to use]
- Accent: [When/where to use sparingly]
- Neutrals: [Text, backgrounds, borders]

**Rationale**: [Why these color choices serve the feature]

### Typography Treatment
**Heading Hierarchy** (from brand.md scale):
- H1: [Size] - [When to use]
- H2: [Size] - [When to use]
- H3: [Size] - [When to use]

**Body Text**: [Size/weight for readability]

**UI Elements**: [Size/weight for clarity]

**Emphasis**: [How to highlight important info]

### Imagery Style
**Illustrations**: [Style, color treatment]
**Photography**: [Mood, composition guidelines]
**Icons**: [Style, size, stroke weight]

## Component Aesthetics

### [Component Name]

**Purpose**: [What this component does]

**Visual Treatment**:
- Background: [Color from brand.md]
- Border: [Style, color, radius from brand.md]
- Shadow: [Elevation level from brand.md]
- Padding: [Using brand.md spacing system]

**Typography**:
- Label: [Size/weight from brand.md]
- Content: [Size/weight from brand.md]

**States**:
- Default: [Visual appearance]
- Hover: [Change on hover - color, elevation, etc.]
- Active/Focus: [Clear focus indicator]
- Disabled: [Reduced opacity or grayscale]
- Error: [Error color from brand.md]

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Mobile: [How it adapts]
- Tablet: [How it adapts]
- Desktop: [How it appears]

### [Additional Components]
[Repeat structure for each component]

---

## Motion & Interaction

### Transitions
**Duration**: [Per principles.md - typically 200-300ms]
**Easing**: [Smooth, natural - ease-in-out recommended]

### Micro-interactions
**Button Hover**: [Subtle color shift, elevation increase]
**Form Focus**: [Border highlight, subtle glow]
**Success Feedback**: [Checkmark animation, color transition]
**Loading States**: [Skeleton, spinner style]

### Animation Purpose
All motion serves a purpose:
- **Feedback**: Confirms user action
- **Orientation**: Shows relationship between elements
- **Focus**: Draws attention appropriately

**Performance**: 
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion (principles.md requirement)
- No animation on initial page load
- GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity)

---

## Responsive Design

### Mobile (< 768px)
**Visual Adaptations**:
- [How hierarchy changes]
- [Which elements stack]
- [Touch target sizes - 44px minimum]

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
**Visual Adaptations**:
- [Sidebar behavior]
- [Grid adjustments]

### Desktop (> 1024px)
**Visual Adaptations**:
- [Full layout]
- [Hover states active]

## Implementation Notes

### Design Tokens Needed
```css
/* Add to design tokens if new */
--new-color-name: #hexvalue;
--new-spacing-name: XXpx;
--new-shadow-name: X Xpx Xpx rgba();
```

### Component Variants
1. **Variant Name**: [Description]
   - Use when: [Context]
   - Differs by: [What changes]

### Asset Requirements
- [ ] Icons needed: [List]
- [ ] Illustrations needed: [List]
- [ ] Photography: [Requirements]
