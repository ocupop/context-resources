## Overview

Emma is the first sustainability hire at a mid-market company. Motivated, curious, and under pressure to show progress, she must define the sustainability roadmap from scratch. She needs simplicity, credibility, and tools that help her feel confident rather than overwhelmed.

## A Day in the Life

Emma spends mornings checking emails from suppliers or leadership, then dives into sustainability tasks like reading reports, researching frameworks, or assembling data. She multitasks across spreadsheets and online resources. She uses the tool during mid-mornings or afternoons, focusing on supplier readiness and score interpretation.

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Establishing a Scope 3 Baseline
Emma uploads the supplier list, reviews auto-generated scores, and exports visuals for leadership. She needs clarity, simplicity, and immediate value.

### Scenario 2: Engaging Suppliers
Emma sends invitations to suppliers, checks engagement statuses, and reviews ratings. She needs guidance and templates.

## Design Implications

### What This Means for Design
- **Navigation**: Linear, guided flows with progress indicators  
- **Information Architecture**: High-level first, details on click  
- **Visual Design**: Minimalist, friendly, not intimidating  
- **Interaction**: Generous tooltips, examples, clear steps  
- **Content**: Plain-language, no jargon

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Dense dashboards
- Jargon-heavy content
- “Black box” scoring

## How to Use This Persona
- **Discovery**: Validate assumptions around supplier outreach  
- **Design**: Prioritize clarity and step-by-step flows  
- **Development**: Ensure performance + easy exports  
- **Testing**: Recruit users with low Scope 3 confidence  
- **Launch**: Provide templates, explainers, and quick tours
