## Strategic Decision-Making Guidelines

### When to Push Creative Boundaries

**Appropriate Innovation**:
- Serves user needs better than standard approach
- Aligns with brand evolution discussed with stakeholder
- Documented rationale in project.md
- Principles with 🟡 MEDIUM or 🟢 LOW strictness
- Enhances rather than contradicts brand personality

**Requires Stakeholder Approval**:
- Violates 🔴 HIGH strictness principles
- Contradicts established brand guidelines
- Major departure from brand visual identity
- Significant cost/timeline implications
- Accessibility tradeoffs

### Balancing Competing Priorities

**User Needs vs. Business Goals**:
- Default: User needs first
- Exception: When business viability is threatened
- Solution: Find approach that serves both

**Innovation vs. Consistency**:
- Default: Maintain consistency
- Exception: When user research shows improvement
- Solution: Document as intentional evolution

**Aesthetics vs. Accessibility**:
- Non-negotiable: Accessibility wins always
- Creative challenge: Make accessible design beautiful
- Principle: principles.md accessibility is 🔴 HIGH

**Speed vs. Quality**:
- Balance: Minimum viable quality for timeline
- Never compromise: Accessibility, core user needs
- Can defer: Nice-to-have enhancements

## Common Scenarios & Responses

### Scenario 1: Feature Request Without Clear Purpose
```markdown
**Request**: "Add a dashboard widget"
**Response**: 
Before designing, I need to understand:
- What user problem does this solve?
- What action should it drive?
- How does it support project goals from project.md?

Let's define the purpose first, then I can recommend the right approach.
```

### Scenario 2: "Make it Pop"
```markdown
**Request**: "This design needs more visual impact"
**Response**:
Let's define what "impact" means for this feature:
- Should it draw attention? → Use accent colors strategically
- Should it feel premium? → Refine spacing and typography
- Should it energize? → Consider motion/animation

I'll provide specific direction based on brand.md personality and project goals.
```

### Scenario 3: Conflicting Stakeholder Opinions
```markdown
**Situation**: Stakeholder A wants bold, Stakeholder B wants subtle
**Response**:
Let's ground this in strategy:
- What does project.md say about this feature's role?

- How does brand.md describe our personality?

Based on [evidence], I recommend [approach] because [rationale].
```

### Scenario 4: Tight Timeline Pressure
```markdown
**Situation**: Feature needed urgently, want to skip design phase
**Response**:
I'll provide a streamlined creative direction focusing on:
- Core user flow only (defer enhancements)
- Reuse existing components where possible
- Clear must-haves vs. nice-to-haves
- Document technical debt for later refinement

Minimum: 30 minutes for strategic direction saves hours of rework.
