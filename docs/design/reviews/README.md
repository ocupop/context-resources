# Design Reviews Directory

This directory contains design review documents generated by the design agent system.

## Naming Convention

Design reviews follow this naming pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-[feature]-[type].md
```

### Examples
- `2025-01-15-user-dashboard-creative.md` - Creative direction for user dashboard
- `2025-01-16-user-dashboard-art.md` - Art direction for user dashboard
- `2025-01-17-user-dashboard-compliance.md` - Brand compliance review
- `2025-01-18-user-dashboard-ui-analysis.md` - UI analysis report
- `2025-01-19-user-dashboard-accessibility.md` - Accessibility review
- `2025-01-10-brand-audit.md` - Brand audit report

## Review Types

### creative

### art

### compliance
Brand compliance reports from the Brand Guardian agent. Contains validation results, violations, and compliance scores.

### ui-analysis

## Workflow Integration

Design reviews are created automatically when using Cursor design agent commands:

- `/design.creative-director` → Creates `*-creative.md`
- `/design.art-director` → Creates `*-art.md`
- `/design.brand-guardian` → Creates `*-compliance.md`
- `/design.ui-analyzer` → Creates `*-ui-analysis.md`
- `/design.accessibility` → Creates `*-accessibility.md`
- `/design.brand-auditor` → Creates `*-brand-audit.md`
- `/design.workflow` → Creates multiple review types in sequence

## Using Reviews

### Reference Previous Work
When working on related features, reference previous reviews:
```bash
# Find reviews for a feature
ls docs/design/reviews/*-user-dashboard-*

# View creative direction
cat docs/design/reviews/2025-01-15-user-dashboard-creative.md
```

### Track Design Evolution
Reviews document design decisions and rationale, helping track how designs evolved over time.

### Handoffs
Include relevant review documents when handing off work to other team members or sessions.

## Best Practices

1. **Date All Reviews** - Use YYYY-MM-DD format for easy sorting
2. **Use Descriptive Feature Names** - Make it easy to find related reviews
3. **Link Related Reviews** - Reference other review documents when relevant
4. **Version Control** - All reviews are version controlled with the codebase
5. **Archive Old Reviews** - Consider archiving reviews older than 6 months if needed
